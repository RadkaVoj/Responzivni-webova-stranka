          <p>
            Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are
            scattered all over this planet; you just need to know where to find
            them. We do. Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, Patagonia, and the Inca
            Trail are out there, waiting for you to walk all over them. We’re
            proud of our record of successful ascents (over 92% of our
            travellers make it to the top of Kili, depending on the route), but
            it’s our CEOs and local guides that make the journey itself as
            memorable as the summit. And if you’re not into big climbs, don’t
            sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact walks and iconic treks
            you’ll love, too.

            She has booked two major European trips for us in the past year and
            every aspect has met, and in most cases exceeded, our expectations.
            Best prices, best hotels, best itineraries, and best cruises, she
            does it all. But the most important thing is she remembers the
            little things that we would do if we were making the plans
            ourselves.

            Leigh McAdam has been making my travel arrangements for about 20
            years and there is no one else I would trust to arrange my trips and
            tours. I've also had great fun on a few of the group trips she has
            arranged - Peru & Machu Picchu and a 10-day cruise out of Venice and
            diving. It's always an eclectic group of well traveled, interesting
            people.
